            <h2><strong><em>About Me</em></strong></h2>
            <p>I'm currently learning at Moringa school, and so far, I'm having so much fun. I have always been fascinated by design and my aim after this course is to transition into the UI/UX team. Having knowledge in developing web and mobile applications will be an added advantage in my journey.
            I am also a self taught digital art illustrator. Art has been the one constat thing in my life. i have been drawing using all mediums; Pencil, charcoal, acrylic and water paints and now digitally. I plan to later use my illustrations in apps and web pages I work on.</p>
